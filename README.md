## What is Yikes?
With restaurant reviewing platforms like Yelp, people are able to more or less say whatever they want, and while content moderation happens, there really isn't any sort of two-way reviewing like in transportation services like Uber or Lyft. What's unfortunate with this, is the weight that a Yelp review holds; it's commonplace for Yelp reviews to come up in performance reviews and similar discussions, and the a low rating early on can be prove difficult for restaurants to recover from.

> *Often, customers will take to platforms like Yelp to complain about their experiences. These sites have only served to bolster the power that customers have. Siker remains frustrated to this day with the first review left on her restaurant's Yelp page. It was opening weekend and her team was understaffed, she recalls, but they were profusely apologetic about it and even offered customers gift cards. Someone left them a two-star review, which then turned into the restaurant’s entire rating. “We are a new restaurant that opened in the middle of pandemic, and this review is still reflecting on us two months later.”*

Yikes flips the script to operate as a platform of reviewer reviews. Hospitality Employees can anonymously leave reviews of guests for others to read and take in. Each review section has an area where the subject's Yelp account can be linked, to provide a frame of reference for the experience described. Because the account is linked, it hopefully encourages Yelp Users who have been linked to Yikes to create more varied reviews-- if someone has all one-star reviews, they are inherently not going to appear credible when they themselves are reviewed on Yikes. If a Yelp user's reviews include a more varied spread that displays consideration when they press "Submit," then they might be reviewed in a more positive light.  

While this could be characterized as antagonistic, it holds just as much credibility as your average Yelp review, and arguably less IRL impact. Yikes hopes to give a release to restaurants and employees who are left without significant responsive action to reviews, as more confrontational engagement can often spiral into a spectacle. "Beware of arguing with fools, because onlookers can't tell the difference." Yikes just cuts through and makes a spectacle chiral to Yelp's example. Is it a solution? Absolutely not. Is it a laugh and a second look at something that we maybe take for granted? I hope so.

- That guy that got into it with me and then tweeted at my company's twitter account specifically about me because I forgot bacon on his BEC during a massive lunch rush at the one-person kitchen I was stuck at. After I said sorry and gave him a gift card. He sucks, and years later I cracked a joke with a coworker, heard a laugh from the other side of the counter, looked up to smile and make eye contact, and recognized that fn guy. Screw you BEC guy, you don't get to laugh at my jokes.
